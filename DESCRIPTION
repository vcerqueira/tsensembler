Description: A framework for dynamically combining forecasting models for time series forecasting predictive tasks. It leverages machine learning models from other packages to automatically combine expert advice using metalearning and other state-of-the-art forecasting combination approaches. The predictive methods receive a data matrix as input, representing an embedded time series, and return a predictive ensemble model. The ensemble use generic functions 'predict()' and 'forecast()' to forecast future values of the time series. Moreover, an ensemble can be updated using methods, such as 'update_weights()' or 'update_base_models()'. A complete description of the methods can be found in: Cerqueira, V., Torgo, L., Pinto, F., and Soares, C.
